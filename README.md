#Gauss Quadratures

Gauss Hermite, Gauss-Laguerre and Gauss-Chebyshev implementation

##Gauss-Hermite

In numerical analysis, Gauss–Hermite quadrature is an extension of Gaussian quadrature method for approximating the value of integrals of the following kind: e^x(-2)*f(x)

##Gauss-Laguerre

In numerical analysis Gauss–Laguerre quadrature is an extension of Gaussian quadrature method for approximating the value of integrals of the following kind: e^-x*f(x)

##Gauss-Chebyshev

In numerical analysis Chebyshev–Gauss quadrature is an extension of Gaussian quadrature method for approximating the value of integrals of the following kind: 1/(sqrt(1-x*x)
